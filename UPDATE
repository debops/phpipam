phpIPAM supports upgrading only to 2 older release, for example only version >= 0.9 can be upgraded to 1.1.


It is recommended that you backup the old phpipam database before you upgrade to new version (change username and pass to ones in config.php):
	/usr/bin/mysqldump -u ipv6 -pipv6admin phpipam > <my_backup_dir>/phpipam_<version>_migration_backup.db

Backup phpipam files:
	mv <mywebdir>/phpipam <myphpipamdir>/phpipam-<version>
