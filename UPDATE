# phpipam update instructions
#

It is recommended that you backup the old phpipam database before you upgrade to new version (change username and pass to ones in config.php):
	/usr/bin/mysqldump -u ipv6 -pipv6admin phpipam > <my_backup_dir>/phpipam_<version>_migration_backup.db

Backup phpipam files:
	mv <mywebdir>/phpipam <myphpipamdir>/phpipam-<version>

	4.) RewriteBase /phpipam/ in .htaccess
