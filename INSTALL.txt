# Install procedure:
#
----------------------------------
1.) Configure the config.php file
----------------------------------
config.php file is where site configuration and database details are configured. Please edit it according to your needs and installation.
	vi config.php

if you have placed phpipam in web subdirectory, you need to modify the following (example for /phpipam/):
	- Set BASE in config.php to /phpipam/
	- RewriteBase /phpipam/ in .htaccess

---------------------------------------------
2a.) Automatic installation of database files
---------------------------------------------
Since v0.4 phpipam can automatically install database files for you.
Point browser to phpipam directory and set MySQL login details (root username and password).


Finished! Launch browser, go to website and if something is missing / not configured properly the error will appear.


------------------------------------------
2b.) First installation of database files
------------------------------------------
Optional method to be used instead of automatic configuration.

MySQL schema file is available under db folder.
First you must create new database, and then import SCHEMA file into database. Instructions below are for command-line import with local mysql installation.
------
mysql -u root -p 
create database phpipam;
exit
------

Import database SCHEME.sql file:
------
mysql -u root -p phpipam < db/SCHEMA.sql
------

Create user for database interaction from website and grant permissions to ipam tables. Please change the username and password (ipv6, ipv6admin) according to your needs - you must also replace default ones in config file, which will be covered in step 2.
------
mysql -u root -p
grant ALL on phpipam.* to ipv6@localhost identified by "ipv6admin";
exit
------






----------------------------------
3.) (optional) Database backups
----------------------------------
It is *strongly* advised to backup database at least on weekly basis -> put following command to your crontab:
------
# Backup IP address table
0 1 * * 1 /usr/bin/mysqldump -u ipv6 -pipv6admin phpipam > <ipam_dir>/db/bkp/phpipam_bkp_$(date +"\%y\%m\%d").db
------
It will backup ipam table each monday at 1AM. Change directories accordingly.


----------------------------------
4.) Misc stuff
